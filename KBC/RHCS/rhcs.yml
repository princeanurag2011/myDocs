  Manage Securities:
   - Configure firewall settings using available firewall utilities:
      - firewall is n/w security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic
        firewalld is firewall daemon, is a complete firewall solution avilable by default
        firewall zones:
          drop:
            - The lowest level of trust. All incoming connections are dropped by default and 
              only outgoing connections are allowed.
      
          Block:
            - similar to drop , but rejected with icmp-host-prohibited or icmp6-adm-prohibited 
              message .
          Public: 
            - untrusted networks, You dont trust other computers but allow selected incoming connections
              case-by-case
          External:
            - Using firewall as a gateway. It is configured using NAT masquerading so that internal n/w
              remains private but reachable.
          Internal:
            - The other side of  external zone, used for internal portion of the gateway. The computers 
               are fairly trustworth and some additional services are available.
          home:
            - default internal private network zone. Doesn't allow incoming from outside network.
          dmz:
            - Used for computer lcated in DMZ (isolated computer that will not have access to the 
              rest of the network). A few more services might be allowed.
          Work:
            - used for work machines. trust most of the computers in the network. 
              A few more service might be allowed
          Trusted:
            - Trust all of the machines in the network. The most open of the available options 
              and should be  used sparingly.

      PORT FORWARDING:
        - port forwarding or port mapping used to send the comm. req to computers that
          are traversing the gateway network
        - #To do the port forwaring using firwall from 80 to 5555
           firewall-cmd --permanent --add-masquerade
