## master $ kubectl expose --help
Expose:

 Expose a resource as a new Kubernetes service.

 Looks up a deployment, service, replica set, replication controller or pod by name and uses the selector for that resource as the selector for a new service on the specified port. A deployment or replica set will be exposed as a service only if its selector is convertible to a selector that service supports, i.e. when the selector contains only the matchLabels component. Note that if no port is specified via --port and the exposed resource has multiple ports, all will be re-used by the new service. Also if no labels are specified, the new service will re-use the labels from the resource it exposes.

 Possible resources include (case insensitive):

 pod (po), service (svc), replicationcontroller (rc), deployment (deploy), replicaset (rs)

 Examples:
  # Create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000.
  kubectl expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in "nginx-controller.yaml", which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000.
  kubectl expose -f nginx-controller.yaml --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name "frontend"
  kubectl expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend

  # Create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name "nginx-https"
  kubectl expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https

  # Create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing UDP traffic and named 'video-stream'.
  kubectl expose rc streamer --port=4100 --protocol=UDP --name=video-stream

  # Create a service for a replicated nginx using replica set, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000.
  kubectl expose rs nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000.
  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

 Options:

      --dry-run=false: If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
      --external-ip='': Additional external IP address (not managed by Kubernetes) to accept for the service. If this IP is routed to a node, the service can be accessed by this IP in addition to its generated service IP.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to expose a service
      --generator='service/v2': The name of the API generator to use. There are 2 generators: 'service/v1' and 'service/v2'. The only difference between them is that service port in v1 is named 'default', while it is left unnamed in v2. Default is 'service/v2'.
  -k, --kustomize='': Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -l, --labels='': Labels to apply to the service created by this call.
      --load-balancer-ip='': IP to assign to the LoadBalancer. If empty, an ephemeral IP will be created and used (cloud-provider specific).
      --name='': The name for the newly created object.
  -o, --output='': Output format. One of:
 json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-file.
      --overrides='': An inline JSON override for the generated object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.
      --port='': The port that the service should serve on. Copied from the resource being exposed, if unspecified
      --protocol='': The network protocol for the service to be created. Default is 'TCP'.
      --record=false: Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
  -R, --recursive=false: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
      --save-config=false: If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
      --selector='': A label selector to use for this service. Only equality-based selector requirements are supported. If empty (the default) infer the selector from the replication controller or replica set.)
      --session-affinity='': If non-empty, set the session affinity for the service to this; legal values: 'None','ClientIP'
      --target-port='': Name or number for the port on the container that the service should direct traffic to. Optional.
      --template='': Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
      --type='': Type for this service: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalName. Default is 'ClusterIP'.

 Usage:
  kubectl expose (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME) [--port=port] [--protocol=TCP|UDP|SCTP] [--target-port=number-or-name][--name=name] [--external-ip=external-ip-of-service] [--type=type] [options]

 By specifying the output as 'template' and providing a Go template as the value of the --template flag, you can filter the attributes of the fetched resources.

 Use "kubectl api-resources" for a complete list of supported resources.

 Examples:
  # List all pods in ps output format.
  kubectl get pods

  # List all pods in ps output format with more information (such as node name).
  kubectl get pods -o wide

  # List a single replication controller with specified NAME in ps output format.
  kubectl get replicationcontroller web

  # List deployments in JSON output format, in the "v1" version of the "apps" API group:
  kubectl get deployments.v1.apps -o json

  # List a single pod in JSON output format.
  kubectl get -o json pod web-pod-13je7

  # List a pod identified by type and name specified in "pod.yaml" in JSON output format.
  kubectl get -f pod.yaml -o json

  # List resources from a directory with kustomization.yaml - e.g. dir/kustomization.yaml.
  kubectl get -k dir/

  # Return only the phase value of the specified pod.
  kubectl get -o template pod/web-pod-13je7 --template={{.status.phase}}

  # List resource information in custom columns.
  kubectl get pod test-pod -o custom-columns=CONTAINER:.spec.containers[0].name,IMAGE:.spec.containers[0].image

  # List all replication controllers and services together in ps output format.
  kubectl get rc,services

  # List one or more resources by their type and names.
  kubectl get rc/web service/frontend pods/web-pod-13je7

 Options:
  -A, --all-namespaces=false: If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
      --allow-missing-template-keys=true: If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
      --chunk-size=500: Return large lists in chunks rather than all at once. Pass 0 to disable. This flag is beta and may change in the future.
      --field-selector='': Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to get from a server.
      --ignore-not-found=false: If the requested object does not exist the command will return exit code 0.
  -k, --kustomize='': Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -L, --label-columns=[]: Accepts a comma separated list of labels that are going to be presented as columns. Names are case-sensitive. You can also use multiple flag options like -L label1 -L label2...
      --no-headers=false: When using the default or custom-column output format, don't print headers (default print headers).
  -o, --output='': Output format. One of: json|yaml|wide|name|custom-columns=...|custom-columns-file=...|go-template=...|go-template-file=...|jsonpath=...|jsonpath-file=...
 See custom columns [http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/#custom-columns], golang template [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview] and jsonpath template
 [http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/jsonpath].
      --raw='': Raw URI to request from the server.  Uses the transport specified by the kubeconfig file.
  -R, --recursive=false: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
      --server-print=true: If true, have the server return the appropriate table output. Supports extension APIs and CRDs.
      --show-kind=false: If present, list the resource type for the requested object(s).
      --show-labels=false: When printing, show all labels as the last column (default hide labels column)
      --sort-by='': If non-empty, sort list types using this field specification.  The field specification is expressed as a JSONPath expression (e.g. '{.metadata.name}'). The field in the API resource specified by this JSONPath expression must be an integer or a string.
      --template='': Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
  -w, --watch=false: After listing/getting the requested object, watch for changes. Uninitialized objects are excluded if no object name is provided.
      --watch-only=false: Watch for changes to the requested object(s), without listing/getting first.

 Usage:
  kubectl get
 [(-o|--output=)json|yaml|wide|custom-columns=...|custom-columns-file=...|go-template=...|go-template-file=...|jsonpath=...|jsonpath-file=...]
 (TYPE[.VERSION][.GROUP] [NAME | -l label] | TYPE[.VERSION][.GROUP]/NAME ...) [flags] [options]

## master $ kubectl edit --help
edit:
 Edit a resource from the default editor.

 The edit command allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts filenames as well as command line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources.

 Editing is done with the API version used to fetch the resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group.
 The default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify "-o json".
 The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise the default for your operating system will be used.

 In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include the latest resource version.

 Examples:
  # Edit the service named 'docker-registry':
  kubectl edit svc/docker-registry

  # Use an alternative editor
  KUBE_EDITOR="nano" kubectl edit svc/docker-registry

  # Edit the job 'myjob' in JSON using the v1 API format:
  kubectl edit job.v1.batch/myjob -o json

  # Edit the deployment 'mydeployment' in YAML and save the modified config in its annotation:
  kubectl edit deployment/mydeployment -o yaml --save-config

 Options:
      --allow-missing-template-keys=true: If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in
 the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to files to use to edit the resource
  -k, --kustomize='': Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -o, --output='': Output format. One of:
 json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-file.
      --output-patch=false: Output the patch if the resource is edited.
      --record=false: Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
  -R, --recursive=false: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
      --save-config=false: If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
      --template='': Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
      --validate=true: If true, use a schema to validate the input before sending it
      --windows-line-endings=false: Defaults to the line ending native to your platform.

 Usage:
  kubectl edit (RESOURCE/NAME | -f FILENAME) [options]

## master $ kubectl edit --help

delete:
 
 Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of the arguments may be specified: filenames, resources and names, or
 resources and label selector.

 Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are
 forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to
 set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be
 acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take
 significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must pass a grace period of 0 and specify
 the --force flag.

 IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can
 leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use
 shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those
 pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data
 corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can
 tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods the scheduler may place new
 pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.

 Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right
 when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

 Examples:
  # Delete a pod using the type and name specified in pod.json.
  kubectl delete -f ./pod.json

  # Delete resources from a directory containing kustomization.yaml - e.g. dir/kustomization.yaml.
  kubectl delete -k dir

  # Delete a pod based on the type and name in the JSON passed into stdin.
  cat pod.json | kubectl delete -f -

  # Delete pods and services with same names "baz" and "foo"
  kubectl delete pod,service baz foo

  # Delete pods and services with label name=myLabel.
  kubectl delete pods,services -l name=myLabel

  # Delete a pod with minimal delay
  kubectl delete pod foo --now

  # Force delete a pod on a dead node
  kubectl delete pod foo --grace-period=0 --force

  # Delete all pods
  kubectl delete pods --all

 Options:
      --all=false: Delete all resources, including uninitialized ones, in the namespace of the specified resource types.
  -A, --all-namespaces=false: If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current
 context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
      --cascade=true: If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a
 ReplicationController).  Default true.
      --field-selector='': Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector
 key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.
  -f, --filename=[]: containing the resource to delete.
      --force=false: Only used when grace-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful
 deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires
 confirmation.
      --grace-period=-1: Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative.
 Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).
      --ignore-not-found=false: Treat "resource not found" as a successful delete. Defaults to "true" when --all is
 specified.
  -k, --kustomize='': Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
      --now=false: If true, resources are signaled for immediate shutdown (same as --grace-period=1).
  -o, --output='': Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
  -R, --recursive=false: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage
 related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on, not including uninitialized ones.
      --timeout=0s: The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the
 size of the object
      --wait=true: If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.

 Usage:
  kubectl delete ([-f FILENAME] | [-k DIRECTORY] | TYPE [(NAME | -l label | --all)]) [options]
