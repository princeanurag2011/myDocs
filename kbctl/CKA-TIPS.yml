Certification Tip:
  Here's a tip: 
  As you might have seen already, it is a bit difficult to create and edit YAML files. 
  Especially in the CLI. During the exam, you might find it difficult to copy and paste YAML files from browser to terminal.
  Using the kubectl run command can help in generating a YAML template. And sometimes, you can even get away 
  with just the kubectl run command without having to create a YAML file at all. 
  For example, if you were asked to create a pod or deployment with specific name and image 
  you can simply run the kubectl run command.

  #Use the below set of commands and try the previous practice tests again,
  # but this time try to use the below commands instead of YAML files. 
  #Try to use these as much as you can going forward in all exercises
  #Reference (Bookmark this page for exam. It will be very handy):

 #Create an NGINX Pod:
     kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx --image=nginx
 #Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) :
     kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 nginx --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml
  #Create a deployment
     kubectl run --generator=deployment/v1beta1 nginx --image=nginx
  #Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)
     kubectl run --generator=deployment/v1beta1 nginx --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml
   #Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) with 4 Replicas (--replicas=4)
     kubectl run --generator=deployment/v1beta1 nginx --image=nginx --dry-run --replicas=4 -o yaml
   #Save it to a file - (If you need to modify or add some other details before actually creating it)
     kubectl run --generator=deployment/v1beta1 nginx --image=nginx --dry-run --replicas=4 -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
